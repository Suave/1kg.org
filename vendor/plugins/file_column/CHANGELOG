*svn*
    * allow for directories in file_column dirs as well
    * use subdirs for versions instead of fiddling with filename
    * url_for_image_column_helper for dynamic resizing of images from views
    * new "crop" feature [Sean Treadway]
    * url_for_file_column helper: do not require model objects to be stored in
      instance variables
    * allow more fined-grained control over :store_dir via callback
      methods [Gerret Apelt]
    * allow assignment of regular file objects
    * validation of file format and file size [Kyle Maxwell]
    * validation of image dimensions [Lee O'Mara]
    * file permissions can be set via :permissions option
    * fixed bug that prevents deleting of file via assigning nil if
      column is declared as NON NULL on some databases
    * don't expand absolute paths. This is necessary for file_column to work
      when your rails app is deployed into a sub-directory via a symbolic link
    * url_for_*_column will no longer return absolute URLs! Instead, although the
      generated URL starts with a slash, it will be relative to your application's
      root URL. This is so, because rails' image_tag helper will automatically
      convert it to an absolute URL. If you need an absolute URL (e.g., to pass
      it to link_to) use url_for_file_column's :absolute => true option.
    * added support for file_column enabled unit tests [Manuel Holtgrewe]
    * support for custom transformation of images [Frederik Fix]
    * allow setting of image attributes (e.g., quality) [Frederik Fix]
    * :magick columns can optionally ignore non-images (i.e., do not try to
       resize them)

0.3.1
    * make object with file_columns serializable
    * use normal require for RMagick, so that it works with gem
      and custom install as well

0.3
    * fixed bug where empty file uploads were not recognized with some browsers
    * fixed bug on windows when "file" utility is not present
    * added option to disable automatic file extension correction
    * Only allow one attribute per call to file_column, so that options only
      apply to one argument
    * try to detect when people forget to set the form encoding to
      'multipart/form-data'
    * converted to rails plugin
    * easy integration with RMagick

0.2
    * complete rewrite using state pattern
    * fixed sanitize filename [Michael Raidel]
    * fixed bug when no file was uploaded [Michael Raidel]
    * try to fix filename extensions [Michael Raidel]
    * Feed absolute paths through File.expand_path to make them as simple as possible
    * Make file_column_field helper work with auto-ids (e.g., "event[]")

0.1.3
    * test cases with more than 1 file_column
    * fixed bug when file_column was called with several arguments
    * treat empty ("") file_columns as nil
    * support for binary files on windows

0.1.2
    * better rails integration, so that you do not have to include the modules yourself. You
      just have to "require 'rails_file_column'" in your "config/environment.rb"
    * Rakefile for testing and packaging

0.1.1 (2005-08-11)
    * fixed nasty bug in url_for_file_column that made it unusable on Apache
    * prepared for public release
