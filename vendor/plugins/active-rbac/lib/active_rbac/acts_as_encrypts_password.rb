module ActsAsEncryptsPassword
  module ActsAsMethods
    # Calling this method in ActiveRecord::Base then the class will be extended by the
    # aspect that it has a password that gets encrypted. The table that the ActiveRecord
    # class represents must provide a column for the encrypted password, a password salt, 
    # the password hash type. By default, this columns are assumed to have the names
    # "password", "password_salt" and "password_hash_type".
    #
    # The ActiveRecord must thus provide the following attributes:
    #
    # password:: the password of the record
    # password_salt:: the salt to use to make the password hash more secure, randomly
    #                 and automatically generated, read only
    # password_hash_type:: the password hash type to use, currently this is fixed to be
    #                      'sha1', read only
    #
    # The class will get the following new attribute (if you use the defaults mentioned
    # above).
    #
    # password_confirmation:: confirmation of the password, must equal password, either
    #                         both can have been added or none
    #
    # and the following new methods
    #
    # acts_as_encrypts_password?:: returns true
    # update_password(pass):: sets password and password_confirmation to pass
    # password_new?:: returns true if the password has been set after the record
    #                 has been retrieved from the database.
    # password_equals?(pass):: returns true if the record's password equals pass
    # self.valid_password_hash_types:: the names of all valid password hash types
    #
    # The password will automatically be encrypted when the user object is being saved
    # and the password has changed.
    #
    # The record will not validate if only one of password and password_confirmation
    # has been set or both are not equal. password_confirmation is not persisted into
    # the database but only kept in the object
    #
    # The following migration could be used to create a "users" table with the appropriate
    # columns:
    #
    #     class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
    #       def self.up
    #         create_table :users do |t|
    #           t.column :password,      :string, :limit => 128, :null => false # sha-512 ready
    #           t.column :password_salt, :string, :limit => 100, :null => false
    #           t.column :password_hash_type, :string, :limit =>  10, :null => false
    #         end
    #       end
    # 
    #       def self.down
    #         drop_table :users
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # The attributes :password, :password_confirmation, :password_hash_type and
    # :password_salt will be marked by "attr_protected".
    # 
    #--
    # acts_as_password interprets (NOT YET, TODO) the following parameters:
    # 
    # :password_column:: The name of the column for the password.
    # :password_salt_column:: The name of the column for the password salt.
    # :password_hash_type_column:: The name of the column for the password hash type.
