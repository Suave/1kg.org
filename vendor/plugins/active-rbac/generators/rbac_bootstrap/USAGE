Description:
    This generator will bootstrap your project. It creates
    
      * a User, a Role and a StaticPermission model along with migrations.
      * a AnonymousUser class
      * an AuthController with views which provides login and logout actions.
      * tests for all created models and controllers.
    
    Additionally, it
    
      * adds acts_as_current_user_container to your ApplicationController.

Example:
    ./script/generate rbac_bootstrap

    This will create (with 3 existing migrations):
        app/controllers/auth_controller.rb
        app/views/auth/login.rhtml
