= ActiveRbac

ActiveRbac is a Ruby On Rails plugin that supports you in implementing Role
Based Access Control (RBAC) in your application.

active-rbac 0.5.0 is confirmed to work with Ruby On Rail 1.2.2.

There are no external dependencies.

== Documentation

Since ActiveRbac performs much of its functionality through metaprogramming,
the RDOC documentation is of limited use. Instead, the documentation in the
docs directory just below this directory should help. It can also be found
at http://active-rbac.rubyforge.org/docs/.

== Running Tests

To run the tests, you have to install the contents of this directory ("plugin")
into the vendor/plugins directory of a Rails project with completely configured
databases.

There is a Rails project that is meant to be used for this testing in the 
directory "demo" in the directory just below this directory.
