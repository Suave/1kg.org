1. Pick Rails version.  Either dump this plugin in a Rails app and run it from there, or specify it as an ENV var:

  RAILS=2.2.2 rake
  RAILS=2.2.2 ruby test/paranoid_test.rb

2. Setup your database.  By default sqlite3 is used, and no further setup is necessary.  You can pick any of the listed databases in test/database.yml.  Be sure to create the database first.

  DB=mysql rake

3. Profit!!
